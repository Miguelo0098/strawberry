# Project: Strawberry

Scripting operations related to setting up a new GNU/Linux installation.

### Why?

As a Arch Linux user, I like starting fresh once in a while, because Arch. Well, turns out installing all software I need is kind of tedious. So I'm building, with your help :), a script that generates the ONLY script you and I need to set up our freshly new install of your GNU/Linux distro. 

## Features
Strawberry is a tool to create a script that helps you setting up distros. Just proceed with the install of your prefered OS, and execute the file. It will download package, set dotfiles, clone GitHub repos, edit files...
